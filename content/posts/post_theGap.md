## Summarizing my Knowledge Gap

The knowledge gap that emerges from my chosen area of research is the lack of use of big data analytics methodology and practices on economic data. More specifically, I was looking for studies of an interdisciplinary nature but found that only a few of the articles I encountered mentioned *fusion analytics*, which is to combine machine-based methods that are present in Computer Science and the explanatory empiricism involving advanced Econometrics and Statistics. 

For my project, I would like to explore fusion analytics and working on ways to combine the machine-based analysis that Computer Science brings with the theoretical and real-world analysis that Economics brings, especially because these are both my fields of concentration. After reading up extensively on fusion analytics, I have found that not only Computer Science, Econometrics, and Statistics methods and techniques can be employed, but other fields like business analytics and policy analytics can be used. The most important factor to consider when wanting to employ fusion analytics is whether or not the implementation of a combined analysis will bolster the results you get and need to answer your question(s) of interest.

While I was able to find articles discussing fusion analysis, I wasn't able to find much by way of applications of this type of analysis. The applications I did find were not really of interest to me, but they did provide me with some idea of how I could go about combining and leveraging different methods and techniques from Computer Science, Economics/Econometrics, Statistics, Business Analysis, and Policy Analysis to analyze 1 or multiple data sets. This gap is relevant to bridge as it can be a beginning to a whole new way of analyzing data, as well as improving upon the current types of analysis that can be perfomed on data. It's also valuable in that employing fusion analysis will result in more detailed insights on the data and what it covers, and by providing a basis for more sophisticated counterfactual impact analysis. By combining explanatory empiricism and computational power, you not only have the benefit of being able to quickly create, run, and test thousands of hypotheses, models, and simulations, while also having the benefit of statistical and econometric methods, and policy/business informed decisions.

In order to fill the knowledge gap present, I would want to figure out how the computational methodology and practices of traditional data analysis be combined (like Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and data processing methods) with the logical and mathematical theories and methods of economics, econometrics, and statistics. As well as deciding if there are more appropriate use cases than others to employ this combined analysis.

In order to successfully tackle bridging this knowledge gap, I need to do more research and solidify my Computer Science, Economics/Econometrics, and Statistics background. I will also need to choose a research topic to focus on for the analysis, in order to decide which types of analysis from what discipline can be employed.
