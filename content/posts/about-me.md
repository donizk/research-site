**Hello!** My name is *Kyri√© Doniz* and I am a current student at [Allegheny College](allegheny.edu) studying Computer Science and Economics.

Being in my third year, I have been able to explore a variety of topics and have found myself specifically drawn to *web development, software development, and data analytics*. Specifically, I have gained experience with analyzing data using R, writing and debugging programs in C, Java, and Python, and using HTML, CSS, and javaScript to create websites. I also have a background in Information Technology, as I have previously worked in [a helpdesk environment](https://www.duchesne.org/academics/technology/cave), diagnosing and reparing hardware and software issues in Toshiba Portege X20W, Z20T, and Z10T laptops.

On campus, I am involved in the Bonner Service Leader Program, Alpha Chi Omega, Allegheny Panhellenic Council, Allegheny Student Government, Green Students of Color Society, Women in STEM, and Grounds for Change.

Outside of my campus activities and academics, I enjoy hanging out with friends/family/my rabbit, reading, hiking, hammocking, lifting, and listening to music, among many other things.
